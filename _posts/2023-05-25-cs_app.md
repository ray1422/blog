 This title is originally from "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" (CS: APP) LOL. As I consider myself a photographer, there are some experiences to share.


 Let me introduce myself first. I am a nobody computer science student in college who is interested in both computer science and photography. The first time I used a professional camera was in high school when I was doing a project with image enhancement that improves photo quality, such as super-resolution, color correction, and HDR stuff. I was required to take photos with a mobile phone and a Canon DSLR. I knew nothing but was shocked DSLR provides such bad-quality images, including a lot of noise when hand-holding the camera when high ISO set. It's even more noisy than a smartphone as being hand held. I understand it's because small sensors are easier to apply stabilization on it, So I actually shoot with slower shutter speed with mobile devices when shutter speed is auto set, as I didn't know then. I began to study camera and photography and shot some photos.

> It's really poor, right?


 Afterward, I buy myself a Nikon D700 with a cheap price. It cost 200 USD (6000 NTD), and I also buy some old lenses. Actually there are many nikon lenses which are imexpensive with fair quality. The autofocus system is a little bit poor, and the quality is just acceptable as it was made in 2007. At the first, I was no different to others: I wanted to get likes and followings at instagram. I want to shoot nothing but eye candies to get focused (in Mandarin we say "糖水片").
Obviously I failed. It's hard to run social media as it required to post frequently, and acting with followers. As the matter of fact I realized that's not what I want. At that time my dad left me a film camera, A Nikon FM2, bought at he went in college, about 30 years ago.


    I saw Fan Ho's creation in class of photography club by chance. I was amazed by the lights and shadows in monotone and it's even done in traditional darkroom! I started to shot with monochrome, finding lights and shadows on the street, try to tell stories of our society. "film captures memories" the sentence deeply resonated with me as I remmber almost every shot until the photo developed.


 But It wasn't a great time to start to shoot with films. The prices of film are uncontrolled surges as it really cost too much to shoot with, so I capture street scenes using black and white film, and color negatives and reversal film (kodak 5294) for important timing and people. (Actually reversals are cheaper then negatives! What the world?)
Let's talk back to today's topic, creative or social photos? I invited a profressioal photography in creative to our class of photography club, but few people came, whereas the classroom were filled when we invited a "professional commerial photography" who's good at shooting eye candy.


 It's hard to say it's who's fault. I would say the people here are uncultured as jokes. In my opinion they stay in "Love and belonging needs" level of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. They need their posts to be liked, be thumbed, whereas creations need higher level of understanding the story behind it, and  I consider it requires people satisfied all lower needs and whom are reaching "need for self-actualization".


 Nevertheless, the bridge between dreams and reality is always cash. Maybe about 70% people in Taiwan think for just lives. It resulted in the view of Taiwan, everything is just usable, not reaching arts, cultural, and so on.
Bring back to our photo club. Shall we do TikTok stuff to attract more students? If we do, we get money and menbers, and the club won't be closed, but we lose skills and thoughts. If we don't, we're closed to bankrupted. It's ruthless but truth. And It's hard to get balance between them.


 It's just my concern, hoply it'd never come true.
